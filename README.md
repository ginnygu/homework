# homework

1) Check if you have node.js globally in your Mac. You can tell in your terminal by typing node -v. That should tell you which version you are have. If not do brew install node. 

2) Fork this repo and start!

3) Make functions to complete the challenges in main.js. You will have to comment them out once you're done with each challenge. For each one, you can test it with console.log and by running `node main.js` in your terminal. Remember you need to be in the folder to run that! 

4) Commit after every challenge!

5) Link me to your repo when you're done! Good Luck and no slacking!!!

P.S: If you need help/clarification or any questions, message me through slack!
